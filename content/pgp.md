Download my [PGP.asc](/pgp.asc) ([.txt](/pgp.txt)) and use it.
```
pub   rsa2048 2022-12-27 [SCEA]
      D88D9970E9B382B971168B5ED4B3BBFCA4C677CD
uid           Alefvanoon <avn@disroot.org>
sub   rsa2048 2022-12-27 [SEA]
```
Also if youâ€™re using UNIX-like operating systems you can add my key with this command:
```bash
curl 'https://alef.tokhmi.xyz/pgp.asc' | gpg --import
```
